I am undefeated in NBA Live, versions 2004-2007, even when people make me play as the Houston Rockets. And I sing the Eagles' \"Desperado\" to my older dog every night before she goes to sleep and I've been doing that since she was a puppy who wouldn't go to sleep.\n","testimonialText":"She's really engaging, and she was quite fierce. haha. I think that made it easier for us to actually enjoy learning the material.\n\nWent from a 155 to 173 on the practice tests. So amazing and I owe it all to you.\n\nBest teacher ever, no contest. She's young, energetic, obsessed with the LSAT (weird but awesome), uses terrible colloquialisms (LSAT Clams in a Circus for the win!), relates to us on every level (except pop culture...pls never say Justin Beiber again), can't be stumped on any LSAT question...I don't know how anybody could ever want anyone else for their teacher. She was not only an amazing LSAT teacher but also a life coach and a savior on days when this stupid test just wanted to make me give up. PS my parents sat next to me during class one day and they love her too. My dad particularly enjoyed the bacon analogies.\n\nThe class was very difficult and very rewarding. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed my first online class. Kaplan is definitely no University of Phoenix, and Anh-Chi is definitely one in a million. The constant encouragement and positive energy were exactly what I needed to keep me motivated. I will definitely be recommending my peers.\n\nWOW that's all I can say. Best teacher ever! I was really nervous about taking my first online class, and I can confidently say that this class was more helpful, fun, interesting, than ANY CLASS I took in college. AC you are a star in the sky!! Thank you from the bottom of this ninja's heart!!!!\n"},{"imageUrl":"//static-files-domain.com/BobVerini.png","firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Verini","profileVideo":{"source":"weblink","extensions":[{"name":"uri","value":"/brightcove/url/here"}]},"numberOfYearsTeaching":"31","numberOfStudentsTaught":"5,000+","profileText":"FAVORITE SECTION TO TEACH: RC. I have a solid sense of the inner monologue that needs to go on, in a student's head, as she attacks -- and I use that verb deliberately -- a passage.\n\nFAVORITE TYPE OF STUDENT TO TEACH: I am best with the high-ender who wants to go from good to great -- the student who may need to be motivated/consoled but who is sharp enough to see the test as a game playing challenge.\n\nDESCRIBES TEACHING STYLE AS: Dynamic, scaffolded, realistic, tactical, idealistic\n\nBEST ADVICE FOR STUDENTS: Make your mistakes happily, knowing that each misstep reduces the risk of making that mistake again. Focus on the process by which you answered the question, rather than the end product (a right or wrong selection).\n\nFUN FACTS: I won the 1987 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions and recently competed in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades. I'm an Academy Awards completist - and only recently have I discovered how many more of those there are in the world than I ever suspect. Additionally, I'm an accomplished improv actor. Give me a suggestion and I'll give you a scene.\n","testimonialText":"By the end of the course with Bob, not only did I feel prepared, I felt in control. I walked into the building knowing I am an LSAT warrior and I smiled all throughout the exam. My confidence was through the roof. He really makes sure we understand the Kaplan method and as brilliant as he is, I never once felt dumb for asking a question. I also appreciate how fun the class was and how he really made me feel like we were a team. He's a great teacher!\n\nMost amazing guy out there. I feel really honored to have had his course.\n\nThe class allowed for a lot of participation, which I was nervous about since it was my first online class. Bob went at the perfect pace, slowing down when we had questions but also pushing us to get the most material in that we could. His expectations were high which motivated us.\n\nBob was amazing. I wish all my professors were as engaging and caring as Bob. His method of teaching was always clear and concise. And he never let things get dull. He even occasionally would sing, but it would always be on message. Additionally, Bob would pull in interesting outside knowledge or trivia, and he always related it directly to the LSAT.\n"},{"imageUrl":"//static-files-domain.com/BobbyGautam.png","firstName":"Bobby","lastName":"Gautam","profileVideo":{"source":"weblink","extensions":[{"name":"uri","value":"/brightcove/url/here"}]},"numberOfYearsTeaching":"10","numberOfStudentsTaught":"1,300+","profileText":"FAVORITE SECTION TO TEACH: It's a tie between LG and LR. I like teaching LG because it's so invigorating to see students become proficient at something that is so completely foreign to them. And I like teaching LR because it's half the test and there is so much strategy involved.\n\nFAVORITE TYPE OF STUDENT TO TEACH: The most rewarding students to me are the ones who are getting close to their goal score but have hit a wall. NOTHING feels better than helping them fix their process to finally break through those barriers!\n\nDESCRIBES TEACHING STYLE AS: Clear, compassionate, lively, humorous, passionate\n\nBEST ADVICE FOR STUDENTS: Work hard to get ready for the test, but when the test begins don't work harder than you have to.\n\nFUN FACTS: I own 14 video game consoles, 3 handheld gaming devices, and a library of over 2000 games. But I'm also a former competitive weightlifter! I also like to make up my own rap verses and sometimes use them in class for fun.\n","testimonialText":"Honestly, one of, if not the BEST instructor at Kaplan!!!!! Made me even more motivated to learn and practice LSAT at anytime and anyplace; be it laptop, in class, on my phone! Gave me the confidence I needed, the boost I needed to get to where I am today! I started applying the skills I learned in his class to my everyday outside life and my outdoor activities.. And saw a improvement in my writing skills, my vocabulary and just my overall way of talking and creating arguments!\n\nMy score was at a 139-140 now over 160. I think that alone will speak of how great he is :)\n\nBobby was awesome. He opened my eyes to many different techniques that I hadn't received with the previous company that I took a class with.\n\nI truly believe he has been one of the greatest teachers I've ever had!!!! (including my university career). He was always so engaged in the class and brought a level of enthusiasm that I have never witnessed before.\n\nThank you!!! I appreciate the humor as well as being able to adjust on a fly to all sorts of questions.\n"},{"imageUrl":"//static-files-domain.com/HannahGist.png","firstName":"Hannah","lastName":"Gist","profileVideo":{"source":"weblink","extensions":[{"name":"uri","value":"/brightcove/url/here"}]},"numberOfYearsTeaching":"4","numberOfStudentsTaught":"1,300+","profileText":"FAVORITE SECTION TO TEACH: LG, because students are generally clueless at the beginning of the course.

If you want better results, have the courage to CHANGE.\n\nFUN FACTS: FACTS: I took 4 years of Latin as an undergrad and still use it. And every year, I pick a different type of food and make a different version of it each month that year. So far, we've had the year of pie, the year of pizza, and the year of bread.\n","testimonialText":"Did a fantastic job keeping you motivated and active in class. Sometimes we worked on areas I thought I had mastered and she brought in suggestions I had never thought of.\n\nHannah Gist is an outstanding teacher in my opinion. I got a lot more from the class than I initially expected. Mrs. Gist had a lot of tips and pointers about the test that I have been applying during my preparation.\n\nI could not have asked for a better teacher. Hannah was extremely knowledgeable, and went out of her way to help me be successful. Not only was she invested in teaching me the Kaplan principles, but she was invested in me doing my very best on the LSAT in regards to stress management and so much more.\n\nAMAZING\n"},{"imageUrl":"//static-files-domain.com/GeneSuhir.png","firstName":"Gene","lastName":"Suhir","profileVideo":{"source":"weblink","extensions":[{"name":"uri","value":"/brightcove/url/here"}]},"numberOfYearsTeaching":"10","numberOfStudentsTaught":"1,100+","profileText":"FAVORITE SECTION TO TEACH: LG.

If you do those things, the scores end up taking care of themselves.\n\nFUN FACTS: I once spent 5 months living on a kibbutz in Israel where I dug graves for dead dogs and ripped irrigation pipes out of cotton fields.

I really appreciate all of your hard work and expertise (and sense of humor!) Gene made the class fun and enjoyable which really took the edge off of the entire LSAT preparation process.\n\nGene acted as both our teacher and class cheerleader. He was so supportive and got us pumped to participate in class questions as well as gave us stars and cupcakes (pictures of them) for right answers. Both Gene and the TAs really cared about how much we retained and how well we understood the material.\n\nBefore Gene my highest score was 148 and after Gene 166. Enough said. I have personally recommended Gene to at least 12 college students looking to prepare for the LSAT...Coming into contact with Gene, totally by chance, has literally changed my life.\n\nI enjoyed how dynamic Gene was; I'm sure its tough to teach an online course but he did very well.

To be blunt, a lot of students are bad at it and don't know it. They also don't know why. Once you show them that LSAT Reading Comp isn't about reading or comprehension, they understand why they should be approaching it differently.\n\nFAVORITE TYPE OF STUDENT TO TEACH: I don't care what you're good at or bad at when you enter my classroom. I don't care what your goal is or what you scored on the diagnostic. What I care about is that you're honest with yourself, want to improve, and willing to work at it. I truly believe that most anyone can hit most any goal if they are willing to do the work.\n\nDESCRIBES TEACHING STYLE AS: Energetic, positive, strategic, honest.\n\nBEST ADVICE FOR STUDENTS: The LSAT is not an IQ test, a test of character, or a test of worth. The LSAT tests a specific set of skills that are learned.\n\nFUN FACTS: I've played the guitar for 15 years--mostly acoustic, but I've been working on driving my wife crazy with an electric guitar and banjo ukulele recently.

Ged was very engaging and upbeat, clearly knows the test very well, knows how to make us understand it (which is even more useful)... He seems like a really nice guy, too - which had the surprising effect of making the test seem considerably less intimidating. Great teacher.\n\nGed was incredible! I truly believe that he cared about his students and their success. He was always energetic and enthusiastic!

I play jazz trombone in a big band. I own two English bulldogs, Butch and Cassidy, and I also have a growing collection of bulldog memorabilia! I have taught a wide variety of courses (English literature, composition, rhetoric, and of course LSAT, GRE, and SAT) to a wide variety of students in high school, community college, private colleges, and public universities.

I was worried I'd have some boring, dull teacher and she blew me away.\n\nNicole is an amazing teacher. Funny, interesting, compassionate, patient...
